Disclaimer

Software is also freespeach.  There may be a few things that a few
of you don't like about this program.  In particular, there is one
political remark that precisely 50% of you are not going to like.
Oh well, please don't say I didn't warn ya.  Its all meant in good fun.

There are several abilities in the game that will allow you to do several
things.  

o Camping - allows you to camp once a day and regain some energy.
            Things needed to camp: camping ability and a camping item.
            A down coat will work.

o Acting  - allows you to use cunning to hustle the rednecks and 
            ruffians.  Also allows you to pretend to be a zombie to 
            avert the attacks of groups of zombies.

o Medical - allows you to heal 1-n sick people you find in groups of
            people along with the able bodied that may or may not wish
            to join you.  The healed will join your group automatically
            out of gratitude.

o Science - Science is the last ability available.  The ultimate goal
            of the game is to find a cure to the virus that causes the
            zombie plague.  The science skill is necessary in order to
            win the game.  The science skill will also allow you to throw
            some antidote on a group of zombies and "turn" some of them,
            either back to being healed or back into being dead.
